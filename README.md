## Inspiration
Introducing the Discord DJ! All of us love the functionality in Discord to play music in voice channels, but we felt that more could be done to enhance this feature. Through this project, we sought to creatively optimize the experience of playing music in Discord by creating a bot that adjusts songs within a queue based on popular demand!

## Overview
To get started with the Discord DJ, you can select a genre of your choice to play a random song or add songs to queues based on genre or song title! We've enabled many features for the bot -- it can pause, resume, clear queue, skip, and stop. It can also find the song that's currently being played or a similar one and add either to the queue.

## Built with:
We primarily used the Discord + Spotify APIs as the basic framework for our project. In order to ensure that the bot would output the YouTube links to the chosen songs, we utilized the ytdl-core module. All of our code was written in Javascript.
